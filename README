# Bacnet-scan

Bacnet-scan is a small network utility build on top of the Serotonin Bacnet4j GPL3 library. (http://sourceforge.net/projects/bacnet4j/)

## Usage

To scan a network, simply execute the compiled JAR file and input a BACnet device number.
The result is exported in an html file, ready to be sent to a server to interpret the data.

If you want to make your own application, you should probably start with the BACnet4j stack directly.
