# Bacnet-scan

Bacnet-scan is a small network scan utility built on top of the Serotonin BACnet4J GPLv3 library. (http://sourceforge.net/projects/bacnet4j/). BACnet/IP only!

## Usage

To scan a network, simply execute the compiled JAR file and input a BACnet device number. The other fields can generally be left with their default configuration. The local IP and the broadcast address are generated with your machine information at each run, hopefully making it easier for the user.

The result is exported in an html file, ready to be sent to a server to interpret the data.


Feel free to use/modify this application as you please. If you want to make your own custom BACnet application, you should probably use BACnet4J directly.
