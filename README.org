* BACnet Help Network Scan

  Small BACnet scanner. Takes snapshots of the network to enable
  future consultation. BACnet/IP only!

** How to use

   [[./Bacnet-scan/raw/master/img/scanner.png]]

   To scan a network, simply execute the compiled JAR (or the wrapped
   EXE). If you are on standard BACnet network, you should see some
   devices appear in the /found devices/ window. You then just have to
   press "SCAN" and let the magic happen.

   Once a scan is completed, the information is exported in an HTML
   file in the same folder as the scanner itself, or in some cases in
   the =HOME= folder. Either way, the scanner should open the HTML
   automatically to give you the opportunity to send the data back to
   [[http://bacnethelp.com][BACnet Help]], where it can be further analyzed.

   If you don't immediately have access to an Internet connection,
   simply grab the HTML file and open it later when you are connected
   to the network.

*** Advanced settings

    [[./Bacnet-scan/raw/master/img/scanner2.png]]

    - Scanner ID :: This is the device instance with which the scanner
                    will broadcast itself to the network. It *must
                    not* be the same ID as another device on the
                    network.
    - Range min :: The minimum device ID to scan. Must be used with
                   /Range max/.
    - Range max :: The maximum device ID to scan. Must be used with
                   /Range min/.
    - Broadcast address :: IP address on which to send the /WhoIs/
         request and then perform the scan. The scanner already gives
         you the most probable address for your network by default.
         You can also input an URL (such as www.bacnethelp.com), the
         scanner will make the DNS resolving automatically for you.
    - Destination port :: Port to send and receive the IP packets. By
         default, BACnet uses 47808.
    - Download trendlogs :: When chosen, the scan will retrieve the
         trendlogs info. They will available in a graph form once
         uploaded to [[http://bacnethelp.com][BACnet Help]].
    - Download devices backups :: If the devices support file transfer
         and backups, the scanner will try to download them. A scan
         would then make a total backup of the network, enabling you
         to restore it to this exact state anytime in the future.
    - Backup password :: Some devices ask for a password to enable a
         backup. If the password is incorrect, the device will simply
         refuse to give its backup. The scanner will then continue
         the scan as usual.

*** BACnet/IP
    For the scanner to work, there must be *at least* one BACnet/IP
    device able to route packets from other non-IP devices.

    If such a device is on the network, then other BACnet devices
    (such as MS/TP and Ethernet) will be scanned as well. 
*** Medium to big networks (> 15 devices)
    The bigger the network, the longer the scan will take (and the
    more chances there is for an error to occur). It is recommended to
    start you first scan with a low range width (using /Range min/ and
    /Range max/) of 4-5 devices and to increase it if everything works
    fine. Every scan will be merged once sent to /BACnet Help/ anyway
    (if sent in the same project).

*** Troubleshot
    - "I can't scan, the button is greyed out!" :: 
      If there isn't a single device found on the network, the scanner
         won't let you start a scan. 
    - "I don't see any devices in the /found devices/ window!" ::
      There can be many sources to this problem. Check if you have
      configured the right port. Usually BACnet uses 47808, but it
      could as easily be 47809 or any other port number. If you are
      sure of your port number, also make sure the BACnet/IP on the
      network is properly configured. 

** Open source
   Bacnet-scan is a small network scan utility built on top of the
   Serotonin BACnet4J GPLv3 library.
   (http://sourceforge.net/projects/bacnet4j/).

   Feel free to use/modify this application as you please. The source
   can be found [[https://github.com/Frozenlock/Bacnet-scan][here]]. If you want to make your own custom BACnet
   application, you should probably use BACnet4J directly, as it
   offers a wide range of functions unused in this application.
